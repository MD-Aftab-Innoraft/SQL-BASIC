Advantages:-
The fixtures table is independent of the team table thereby migitating the
use of complex SQL queries for retrieving relevant information. The table shows
apt and easy to understand data.

Disadvantges
Redundancy as we are repeating the team names again and again which could have
been avoided.
Additionally, the integrity of the data in the fixtures table is dependent on
the integrity of the data in the teams table. If a team is deleted from the
teams table, it could potentially leave orphaned references in the fixtures
table, leading to data inconsistency.
